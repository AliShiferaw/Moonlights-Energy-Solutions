2. Install the required Python packages: 

pip install -r requirements.txt 

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook file Ten Week Zero_EDA.ipynb: jupyter notebook Ten\ Week\ Zero_EDA.ipynb 
Ensure the dataset (benin-malanville.csv) is placed in the correct directory as specified in the code (file_path variable).
Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Features

Data loading and preview
Statistical summaries
Visualization of data trends
Handling of missing values
Generation of plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Install them using:
    
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn 


## Configuration

Update the dataset path in the notebook to point to your local copy:


    file_path = r"path_to_your_dataset/benin-malanville.csv" 

## Documentation

The project involves:
1. Data Loading: Reads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Data Cleaning: Handles missing or erroneous data points.

3. Visualization: Creates various plots (e.g., line charts, histograms) to illustrate trends and distributions.

Refer to the comments in the notebook for detailed explanations of each step.

## Examples

Here is an example of loading the dataset and previewing its structure:
import pandas as pd 

file_path = r"path_to_your_dataset/benin-malanville.csv" 
df = pd.read_csv(file_path) 
print(df.head())
